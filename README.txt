README for Neighborhood Map Tool

Hi! Thanks for using the Neighborhood Map Tool. The Neighborhood Map Tool displays information about venues in the downtown Atlanta area based on keywords submitted by the user. The user can find out more about each venue by inspecting the map and by clicking on links to visit the venue’s page on the Foursquare official website. The tool uses the Foursquare API.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Save the directory that includes index.html, the “css” subfolder, and the “js” subfolder to a location on your machine, such as your Desktop.
2) Open index.html in your favorite browser. 

The tool will be ready to use, right in your browser. Happy searching!
